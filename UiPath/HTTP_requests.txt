Get Screenshot: This is a GET request that will got the screenshot back after the automation has completed. You have to be sure the automation has completed before returning the output of this, so it is recommended to delay by 6-8 seconds between the previous request and this one. The "value" field will be a list. Take the first element of that list and compare the value of the "Key" attribute to the key you found in the post request earlier. If it doesn't match, move to the next item in the list. Once you find the correct item in the list, you need its "OutputArguments" attribute. That will look like this: "{\"Screenshot\":\"[Screenshot]\"}" where [Screenshot] is the data you need.
